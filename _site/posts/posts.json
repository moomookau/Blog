Conclusion\r\n4. References\r\n\r\n1. Introduction\r\nThis post will be looking at the following data visualisations to identify possible areas of improvement. The data visualisations were created by a research scientist of a research team conducting study to understand the willingness of the public to take COVID-19 vaccinations.\r\nOriginal VisualisationsWe will also come up with a proposed design and implement it in tableau. Next, a step-by-step guide will be provided for coming up with the proposed design. Finally, we will list down major observations that we are able to derive from the proposed design.\r\n2. Task\r\nThe tasks can be summarised as follows:\r\nCritic the existing visualisation\r\nSketch a proposed design\r\nImplement the proposed design\r\nProvide steps for replication of the proposed design\r\nMajor observations derived from the proposed design\r\n2.1 Critic\r\n\r\nCritic the graph from both its clarity and aesthetics. At least three from each evaluation criterion.\r\n\r\nIn terms of clarity, the following areas could be improved:\r\nThere is no lead in paragraph for the visualisations, making in hard to determine what message is being conveyed to the viewer.\r\nThe title of the left visualisation is supposedly about whether a country is pro-vaccine. However, it only utilises the response for the question “If a Covid-19 vaccine were made available to me this week, I would definitely get it.” to draw the conclusion. However, there could be other factors which contribute to how people would respond to the question e.g. the prevalence of COVID-19 in a country, the attitude of the people to COVID-19, the standard of healthcare in a country.\r\nBoth the visualisations represent the results as a percentage of the total records for each country. However, the viewer is not able to tell how many total results there are and may not know how representative the results is of the country. For example, a graph of only 10 results will not be as good a representation of a population compared to a graph of 1000 results.\r\nThe two visualisations are not sorted consistently. The left visualisation is sorted by alphabetical order in terms of country, while the right one is sorted by the % of respondents who strongly agreed. This may be confusing to the viewer who may assume that both are sorted in the same way.\r\nThe left visualisation uses 100% stacked bars, but this may be difficult to compare results of different countries\r\nThe right visualisation only shows the proportion of users who strongly agreed. However, it may make more sense to show both those who scored 1 (strongly agree) and those who scored 2 if we want to convey the message of people who agree.\r\nThe source of the data was not provided and therefore the viewer may not know where the data was sourced from.\r\nIn terms of aesthetics, the following areas could be improved:\r\nThe left visualisation uses a five-colour scheme to colour the different values. However, there is no meaning to the colour scheme, and it would be better to use opposing colours for those that agree and those that disagree.\r\nThere is a typo error in the first visualisation, where pro-vaccine is wrongly spelled as “pro-vacinne”.\r\nThe viewer will not know what the legend title refers to as it is indicated as “Vac1”.\r\nThe formatting of the tick values in the x-axis is not consistent across both visualisations.\r\n2.2 Sketch of Proposed Design\r\n\r\nWith reference to the critics above, suggest alternative graphical presentation to improve the current design. The proposed alternative data visualisation must be in static form. Sketch out the proposed design. Support your design by describing the advantages or which part of the issue(s) your alternative design try to overcome.\r\n\r\nThe following is a sketch of the proposed design:\r\nSketch of Proposed DesignThe proposed design comprises various controls on the top and two visualisations.\r\nThe controls will allow the viewer to select the following:\r\nSurvey Question\r\nShow Measures - Actual Mean, 95% and 99% error bars\r\nBreakdown By - To further breakdown the results by Age, Gender, Household Size, or Household Children\r\nSort By - To sort alphabetically by Country name or the Value\r\nSort Order - To sort in an ascending or descending manner\r\nThe top visualisation shows the proportion of survey respondents who agree with the survey question. It further includes the 95% and 99% error bars.\r\nThe bottom visualisation further breakdowns the survey results by various metrics.\r\nThe proposed design improves on the original design on the following areas:\r\nThe controls allow the viewer to choose the survey question and the respective results. This lets the viewer know how people responded, rather than using only a single question to deem how pro-vaccine a country is.\r\nThe inclusion of error bars provides a better visualisation of the uncertainty around the results. For example, certain countries may have less results and thus there is more uncertainty in the results. Without showing this uncertainty, the viewer may assume that the results are representative of the population of the countries.\r\nThe second visualisation lets viewers drilldown into the results by more metrics. This allow further analysis of the data to see if there is difference when broken down. For example, we are able to tell how males and females responded.\r\nThe controls allow the viewer to sort the results in a meaningful way. Sorting by country allows consistent placement to compare across various survey questions, while sorting by value allows comparison on how the different countries responded to the surveys.\r\n2.3 Proposed Data Visualisation\r\n\r\nUsing Tableau, design the proposed data visualisation.\r\n\r\nProposed Data VisualisationThe proposed data visualisation has been uploaded to Tableau Public and can be found here.\r\n2.4 Step-by-step Description\r\n\r\nProvide step-by-step description on how the data visualisation was prepared.\r\n\r\nThe following sections describe how the data visualisation was prepared.\r\n2.4.1 Data preparation\r\nThe data used for the visualisations were gotten from the Imperial College London YouGov Covid 19 Behaviour Tracker Data Hub. There was one data file for each country, and the data files had different times when they were last updated ranging from 5 months ago to few days ago. Only countries with data that was updated recently, i.e. in the last 2 weeks, were used for our visualisation. Israel was excluded as it was only added in February 2021. The final data included the following countries - Australia, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Norway, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom.\r\nTableau Prep Builder (TPB) was used to prepare our data file. First, all the files were put into the same folder. Next, one of the files was loaded into TPB. The multiple files option in TPB was used to load all the files together as a wildcard union:\r\nWildcard Union of all the filesEach data file contained around 400 columns of data and each row of data was comprised survey responses and survey respondent demographics. Only data with vaccine related questions (e.g. vac_1, vac2_1, vac3) as well as survey respondents’ demographics (e.g. gender, age) were retained. We excluded the other columns of data that were not used. The following columns were retained:\r\nColumns RetainedNext, a “clean” step was added. For cleaning, we first filter responses which were in 2021:\r\nFiltering data by dateNext, we renamed the file paths column as “Country”. We also renamed all the values e.g. australia.csv, singapore.csv to their proper country names e.g. Australia, Singapore:\r\nRenaming CountryFinally, the prepared data was saved for further use in Tableau:\r\nOutput Data for use in Tableau2.4.2 Load Data\r\nThe prepared data was loaded in Tableau. Next, we created groups for the Age, Household Children, and Household Size columns. This allowed us to present the data in an aggregated manner.\r\nGrouping for AgeGrouping for Household ChildrenGrouping for Household Size2.4.3 Creating Parameters\r\nA new sheet is created for the first visualisation. In order to allow interactivity for the visualisations, we create a few parameters.\r\nWe first create a parameter to let the viewer choose the survey question. This parameter will be used to control which survey question the visualisation will show the results for.\r\nParameter for Survey QuestionWe created a corresponding calculated field to select the appropriate column based on the choice of survey question.\r\nCalculated Field for Survey FieldNext, we create a parameter called “Show”. This will allow the viewer to select which elements to show, i.e. whether to show the Actual Mean, the 95% error bar, and/or the 99% error bar.\r\nParameter for ShowWe create a parameter called “Breakdown By” to allow the viewer to breakdown the results by various metrics.\r\nParameter to Breakdown ByWe create a corresponding calculated field to select the appropriate column based on the viewer’s selection.\r\nCalculated Field for Breakdown FieldLastly, we create two more parameters to allow the viewer to control the sorting.\r\nParameter for Sort ByParameter for Sort OrderFinally, we right click on all the parameters and select “Show Parameter” to show them on the worksheet.\r\n2.4.4 Creating Fields for Visualisation\r\nNext, we create the various fields that will support the visualisation.\r\nWe create a field called “Total Respondents”. This field will sum up the total number of respondents, excluding the aggregation at the “Country” level. This field will mainly be used for the title to show the total number of respondents.\r\nTotal Respondents FieldNext, we create a field for the percentage of respondents who agree. This is computed by summing the people who responded with “1 - Strongly agree” or “2” and dividing it by the number of respondents.\r\n% Agree FieldNext, we create a field for the total mean, without aggregation at the “Country” level. Similar to total respondents, this will be used for the title as well as the reference line.\r\nTotal Mean FieldNext, we create two constant fields for the 95% and 99% z values. These will be used to compute the 95% and 99% error bars.\r\nZ 95% Constant ValueZ 99% Constant ValueNext, we create a field for “Standard Error”. Standard error is computed using the following formula:\r\n\\[\\sqrt{\\frac{percentage * (1-percentage)}{sample size}}\\]\r\nThis is translated to the following calculated field:\r\nStandard Error FieldNext, we create the fields to get the margin of error for 95% and 99%:\r\nMargin of Error 95%Margin of Error 99%Next, we created four fields for the upper and lower values of 95% and 99%.\r\nLower 99% ValueUpper 99% ValueLower 95% ValueUpper 95% ValueNext, we create the fields that will be used to display the elements on the visualisation. The “Show” parameter created earlier is used to control which elements to show. By checking if the parameter contains the various values, we show the relevant elements as appropriate.\r\nLower 99% with Show checkUpper 99% with Show checkLower 95% with Show checkUpper 95% with Show checkFinally, we create “Sort Field” to control how we sort the elements on the graph.\r\nSort Field2.4.5 Creating Survey Results Visualisation\r\nWe first add the “% Agree” field to the Columns shelf and the “Country” field to the Rows shelf.\r\nWe change the mark to circle to display the % who agree as a circle on the visualisation.\r\nWe adjust the x-axis to be fixed from 0 to 1, with tick marks at intervals of 0.1. We also change the format for the x-axis to be in percentage with no decimal places.\r\nWe drag “Measure Values” to the Columns shelf. We remove the irrelevant measures from the “Measure Values” shelf, leaving only the Upper/Lower 95%/99% values.\r\nMeasure valuesWe change the axes to dual axis and synchronise the axes. We change the second axis to use “line” and drag “Measure Names” to the “Path” icon.\r\nWe click the detail icon to change it to colour, to colour the different error bars. We change the colours in the legend to light gray for 99% and dark gray for 95%. We also change the previous mark for “% Agree” to blue.\r\nSince we are using calculated fields to show or hide the error bars, we want to hide the indicator that shows that there are null values. We do this by going to “Analysis > Special Values > Hide”.\r\nWe also hide the top axis since both axes are synchronised. We do this by right-clicking on it and unticking “Show Header”.\r\nTo show the percentage next to the name of the countries, we drag “% Agree” to the Rows shelf to the right of “Country”. We change it from a continuous measure to a discrete measure. We also change the number format for “% Agree,” and the other 95% and 99% values to a percentage with 0 decimal places.\r\nTo implement our custom sort using our two parameters, we sort “Country” in the row shelf using the following settings:\r\nSettings for SortWe add another element to show the Grand Total by going to “Analysis > Totals > Show Column Totals” and also “Column Totals to Top”. This will show us the result for all survey respondents.\r\nNext, we drag the “Mean” and “Total Respondents” fields to the detail icon of the “AGG(% Agree)” mark. This will allow us to use them for the title of the visualisation and the reference line. We add a reference line to show the overall mean:\r\nReference Line for Overall MeanWe add a meaningful title to the visualisation:\r\nVisualisation TitleWe create a new calculated field “Number of Respondents” to allow us to show the number of respondents for the survey. This field will take a constant value of 1, but will allow us to sum it to get the number of respondents. This field is similar added to the detail icon.\r\nWe add meaningful tooltips for the mean and error bars:\r\nTooltip for % AgreeTooltip for Error BarsWe add animation to the analysis to allow the viewer to visualise the changes better.\r\nThe final visualisation for the survey results is as follows:\r\nVisualisation for Survey Results2.4.6 Creating Visualisation for further breakdown of results\r\nIn order to create another visualisation to breakdown the results, we duplicate the previous worksheet to minimise the number of steps required. We rename the duplicated sheet as “Breakdown of Results”.\r\nSince we want to breakdown by another field instead of country, we replace “Country” in the rows shelf with “Breakdown Field”.\r\nWe change the reference line to use the total of “% Agree”.\r\nReference Line for Breakdown VisualisationSince we no longer need the total respondents for this visualisation, we remove it from the detail. Instead, we add the “Breakdown By” field.\r\nWe change the tooltips to dynamically display the breakdown field label:\r\nTooltip for Mean of Breakdown VisualisationTooltip for Error Bars of Breakdown VisualisationThe final visualisation for the breakdown is as follows:\r\nVisualisation for Breakdown of Results2.4.7 Combining it together into a Dashboard\r\nFinally, we create a Dashboard to combine both visualisation. The following steps were done to create the worksheet:\r\nDrag both worksheets into the dashboard area.\r\nWe add texts the top and bottom of the dashboard for the title and source used for the charts. We add the parameter controls to the top of the chart.\r\nWe resize the areas for the various visualisation for aesthetic purposes.\r\nWe add an action to allow interactivity between the two visualisations. Selecting a country on the top visualisation will show the breakdown for that country only in the bottom visualisation.\r\nFilter Action\r\nThe final product of the proposed visualisation in the form of a dashboard is as follows:\r\nFinal Visualisation2.5 Major Observations\r\n\r\nDescribe three major observations revealed by the data visualisation prepared.\r\n\r\nUsing the proposed data visualisations, we can observe the following:\r\nMore people would like to adopt a “wait and see” approach for getting the vaccine. Comparing the responses for the question on whether they are willing to take the vaccine this week against whether they are willing to take the vaccine a year from now, the percentage of people who agree increased for all countries except for Germany:\r\nWillingness to take vaccine this weekWillingness to take one year from now\r\nOlder people were generally more willing to take the vaccine as compared to younger people. This could be due to the fact that they are less worried about potential side effects of the vaccine as compared to younger people.\r\nFemales were more worried about the potential side effects of a COVID-19 compared to males. This can be seen from the results where the proportion of females in all countries exceeded the proportion of males who agreed that they were worried about the potential side effects.\r\nThe residents of Japan have less believe in their Government to provide them with an effective vaccine. This can be seen by the fact that only 47% (2nd lowest among all countries) believe that their Government will provide them with an effective vaccine, but only 37% (2nd lowest among all countries) of them willing to take a vaccine this week and 68% (highest among all countries) of them worried about getting COVID-19. This has also been observed in the following article Survey: Japanese less trusting of government in health crisis, which shows that the Japanese are less trusting of government in a health crisis.\r\n3. Conclusion\r\nIn this post, we look at how to present vaccine survey data for various countries. We identify areas of improvement in terms of clarity and aesthetics for the chart and propose changes to improve the visualisation. We further added interactive elements to enhance viewers’ experience to analyse the data. We implemented the changes in Tableau and were able to arrive at more insights than the original visualisation.\r\n4. References\r\nWexler, S. (2018, August 20).

Next, a step-by-step guide will be provided for coming up with the proposed design. Finally, we will list down major observations that we are able to derive from the proposed design.\r\nTask\r\nThe tasks can be summarised as follows:\r\nCritic the existing visualisation\r\nSketch a proposed design\r\nImplement the proposed design\r\nProvide steps for replication of the proposed design\r\nMajor observations derived from the proposed design\r\nCritic\r\n\r\nCritic the graph from both its clarity and aesthetics. At least three from each evaluation criterion.\r\n\r\nIn terms of clarity, the following areas could be improved:\r\nThe statement above the graph uses age ranges like 55 & over and 25 to 54. However, the graph itself uses a more granular age range. This may be result in viewers having difficult to relate to the statement.\r\nThe statement above the graph refers to the Labour Force Participation Rate (LFPR), but this data is not captured within the graph. This may be confusing to the viewer as they may think the chart represents LFPR.\r\nThe line chart used may not be the best representation for the data as lines are usually used when dealing with continuous data to indicate changes or trends. Since the data presented is of categorical data, it may make more sense to use an alternative representation like a bar chart.\r\nThe lines that show the Median Age for both June 2009 and June 2019 is an attempt to show the relative position of the median. For example, the line for the median age for June 2009 is 1/4 way between the tick marks of 40-44. However, this may confuse the viewers as the x-axis is not meant to be continuous.\r\nIn terms of aesthetics, the following areas could be improved:\r\nThere is no y-axis for the graph, making it difficult for the viewer to know the value of the points.\r\nThe table below is a waste of ink as it is visually difficult for a viewer to compare the numbers.\r\nThe chart title is generic and could be changed to something more impactful so the viewer knows what is the message we want to convey.\r\nSketch of Proposed Design\r\n\r\nWith reference to the critics above, suggest alternative graphical presentation to improve the current design. The proposed alternative data visualisation must be in static form. Sketch out the proposed design. Support your design by describing the advantages or which part of the issue(s) your alternative design try to overcome.\r\n\r\nThe following is a sketch of the proposed design:\r\nSketch of Proposed DesignThe proposed design comprises two charts. The chart on the left compare the resident labour force and resident population for the different age groups for 2009 and 2019. The stacked bar chart will show the absolute numbers of the resident labour force and the residents outside of labour force, with the total length of the bar chart giving the resident population. Using stacked bars will alow us to visualise how the resident labour force and total population has changed for 2009 and 2019.\r\nThe chart on the right will provide a 100% breakdown of the various age groups from 2009 to 2019. This will allow us to observe the trend over the years and see if there has been any shift in the composition.\r\nProposed Data Visualisation\r\n\r\nUsing Tableau, design the proposed data visualisation.\r\n\r\nProposed visualisationThe proposed data visualisation has been uploaded to Tableau Public and can be found here.\r\nStep-by-step Description\r\n\r\nProvide step-by-step description on how the data visualisation was prepared.\r\n\r\nThe following sections describe how the data visualisation was prepared.\r\nData preparation\r\nThe data used for the visualisations were gotten the Ministry of Manpower’s website at https://stats.mom.gov.sg/Pages/Labour-Force-Tables2019.aspx. Specifically, Table 5 Resident Labour Force Participation Rate by Age and Sex, 2009 – 2019 (June) and Table 7 Resident Labour Force Aged Fifteen Years and Over by Age and Sex, 2009 – 2019 (June) were used for our data visualisation.\r\nScreenshot of Table 5 download from MOM’s websiteThe data file was in Excel format, but had to be cleaned in Excel by removing the extra columns and excess rows. Both the files were then merged into a single csv file, with an additional column indicating the type where LFPR refers to the Labour Force Participation Rate and RLF refers to the Resident Labour Force:\r\nScreenshot of csv fileNext, the data was loaded into Tableau Prep Builder for further preparation.\r\nThe data was first pivoted to convert the individual year columns into a single column:\r\nIndividual year columns were pivoted and the resulting columns were named as Year and ValueNext, the data was unpivoted from the Data and Value columns to get 2 columns for LFPR and RLF:\r\nUnpivot dataA calculated field was created to get the Residents Outside Labour Force (ROLF):\r\n[RLF]/[LFPR]*(100-[LFPR])\r\nThe column on LFPR was no longer required and was deleted.\r\nNext, the table was pivoted on the RLF and ROLF columns and given meaningful names.\r\nPivot RLF and ROLF columnsFinally, the prepared data was saved for further use in Tableau:\r\nOutput data for use in TableauLoad Data\r\nThe prepared data was loaded in Tableau:\r\nData was loaded in TableauThe Age Group column was renamed to Age Group (Original). The renaming was done such that we can group this column to aggregate the data further. This will be elaborated on later.\r\nThe Year column was renamed to Date and a calculated field was calculated to extract the year as a numerical value:\r\nCreation of Year ColumnComparison of 2009 and 2019’s Population and Labour Breakdown\r\nWe first create a new Tableau worksheet to compare the population and labour breakdown of 2009 and 2019. The following steps were done to create the worksheet:\r\nDrag the Residents (Thousands) measure to the Column shelf.\r\nDrag the Age Group (Original) dimension to the Row shelf.\r\nWe further aggregate the data by grouping the age groups into 3 groups - 15 - 24, 25 - 55, and 55 & Over.\r\nFurther aggregate the Age Groups\r\nWe add the Year field into the Rows shelf after the Age Group field. Next, we change the year field to a Dimension instead of a Measure, and for it to be a discrete dimension since we only want to compare 2009 and 2019.\r\nWe add the Year field into the filter, make it into a Discrete Dimension, and filter the years 2009 and 2019.\r\nWe drag Age Group to the Colour icon to colour the bar charts by the different age groups.\r\nWe drag Type to the Detail icon, and change Detail to Colour in order to further colour the age groups by the Resident Labour Force (RLF) and the Residents Outside of Labour Force (ROLF).\r\nWe drag Resident (Thousands) to the Label icon to add a Label on the bar charts. We want to display the percentage breakdown of RLF and ROLF and so we use a “Percent of Total” quick table calculation. The calculation was computed using “Table (Across)”.\r\nWe sort according to Age Group (older groups on top) and Year (2019 on top).\r\nWe change the colour of the items, using 3 distinct colours for each age group and lighter and darker shades to differentiate the RLF and ROLF.\r\nLegend Colours\r\nWe resize the chart to make the bars thicker.\r\nWe annotate the chart to provide our insights.\r\nWe provide meaningful titles to the chart and the legend.\r\nThe final product of the worksheet is as follows:\r\nFinal Product of WorksheetComparing Breakdown of Labour Force by Age Group from 2009 to 2019\r\nNext we create a worksheet to compare the breakdown of labour force from 2009 to 2019. The following steps were done to create the worksheet:\r\nWe drag the Year field to the Columns shelf and change it to a discrete dimension.\r\nWe drag the Residents (Thousands) measure to the Rows shelf. As we want to show the % breakdown per year, we use a quick table calculation to calculate the % of total, computing it using Table (Down). We use the same column as the label for the bar graphs.\r\nWe drag the Type field to the Filters shelf. As we want to only show the breakdown for the labour force, we filter by RLF type.\r\nWe drag Age Group to the Colours icon to colour the bar charts by age group.\r\nWe sort the stacked bars by Age Group with the youngest being below and oldest on top.\r\nWe change the colours to make them consistent with our previous worksheet.\r\nWe annotate the chart to provide our insights.\r\nWe provide meaningful titles to the chart, y-axis and the legend.\r\nThe final product of the worksheet is as follows:\r\nBreakdown of Resident Labour Force from 2009 to 2019Combining it together into a Dashboard\r\nFinally, we create a Dashboard to combine both charts. The following steps were done to create the worksheet:\r\nDrag both worksheets into the dashboard area.\r\nWe add texts the top and bottom of the dashboard for the title, description of the message we want the viewer to take away, and the sources used for the charts.\r\nThe final product of the proposed visualisation in the form of a dashboard is as follows:\r\nFinal Product of Proposed VisualisationMajor Observations\r\n\r\nDescribe three major observations revealed by the data visualisation prepared.\r\n\r\nUsing the proposed data visualisation, we can observe the following:\r\nThere are more older residents in the labour force in 2019 compared to 2009, both in terms of percentage and absolute value.\r\nThere are more total older residents, showing that people are living longer.\r\nThe percentage of older residents in the labour force has been increasing over the years, signalling an ageing workforce.\r\nConclusion\r\nIn this post, we look at MOM’s statement and chart describing how the median age of the workforce has shifted from 2009 to 2019. We identify areas of improvement in terms of clarity and aesthetics for the chart and propose changes to improve the visualisation. We implemented the changes in Tableau and were able to arrive at more insights than the original visualisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
